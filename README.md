## Mindless Trainer Editor
An app I built for fun to assist working with trainer data for Pokemon Fandango, a pokeemerald-expansion project.

The app's main advantage is that it automatically handles starter-dependent data and difficulty-related data, two features unique to Fandango's trainer structure. It's not necessarily superior to a text editor for trainer editing if the project lacks these features.

### Possible future features
- Reordering the mons in a trainer's party/ies
- Config options (input and output filepaths, disabling Fandango-exclusive features for general use, etc)
- Reading constants from the pokeemerald project instead of hard-coding them in an Enum class
